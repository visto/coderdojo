## CodeDojo Berlin - Minecraft EinfÃ¼hrung


# Minecraft:
If you don't own a minecraft account yet and you are not able to pay the regular price go ahead and purchase a used account
from a page like [playerauctions.com](https://www.playerauctions.com/minecraft-account/). Personally I haven't tried that
yet so be adviced that some common sense mistrust should be applied. 

# Code: 

Go ahead an visit Rene Hollander's [page](https://github.com/ReneHollander/empty-spigot-plugin.git)
and download the zip or just:

git clone https://github.com/ReneHollander/empty-spigot-plugin.git

Linux/OSX: 

Open Terminal
Navigate into cloned repository
Execute:
./gradlew idea
./gradlew buildSpigot
./gradlew build

# IDEA:
Download [IDEA CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) and install

Add Java SKD:
Configure>> Project Defaults >> Project Structure >> Project >> New... >> /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_xxx.jdk/Contents/Home


Open the empty spigot plugin project in IntelliJ by opening the created .ipr file. Otherwise the run configurations will not be in place for you!



# Tutorials
Spigot is a fork from CraftBukkit and Bukkit-API. So it's basically the same as CraftBukkit and Bukkit-API. So you would search for CraftBukkit Tutorials. For example: 

[Setting a Player on Fire](https://bukkit.gamepedia.com/Plugin_Tutorial#Setting_a_Player_on_Fire)

Now go on and modify the code as shown in the tutorial :) 

# Books

This section is as well in progress, but I've skimmed through this book and it seems to be okay:

[Absolute Beginner's Guide to Minecraft Mods Programming](https://books.google.de/books?id=Aa0wBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=minecraft+mods+programming&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiOhIPj7MjXAhWOzaQKHaNvCmAQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=minecraft%20mods%20programming&f=false)
