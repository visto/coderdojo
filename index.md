# Tutorials
Spigot is a fork from CraftBukkit and Bukkit-API. So it's basically the same as CraftBukkit and Bukkit-API. So you would search for CraftBukkit Tutorials. For example: 

https://bukkit.gamepedia.com/Plugin_Tutorial#Setting_a_Player_on_Fire

Now go on and modify the code as shown in the tutorial :)
